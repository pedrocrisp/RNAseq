OVERVIEW
========

Bash script pipelines to complete an RNAseq differential expression analysis.
Each directory contains scripts with alternative implementations of various
parts of the pipeline. To run, create a script which `source`es the file
containing the implementation of each step you require, and run the function
with the step name. See example.sh for an example.

DESCRIPTION
===========

This is a work in progress


Steps:
- 01: quality control of raw reads (trimming, generation of QC reports, etc)
- 02: alignment of raw reads to reference (everything from raw reads to a bam alignment file)
- 03: post-processing of alignemnts (exracting counts, filtering alignments by arbirtary criteria, etc)
- 04: initial statistical analysis (normalisation, etc if required [may be done in 05])
- 05: differential expression analysis (statstical testing of differential expression)
- 06: post-analysis


There are also some misc scripts, such as index creation etc.
